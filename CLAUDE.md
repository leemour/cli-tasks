# cli-tasks — working rules

Open tasks waiting on the owner — an unanswered question, a request, a mention, a promise — published
as `@wirecat/cli-tasks`. `cli-messaging` feeds it from messages and mounts its commands into tg-cli
and max-cli. Start with the one page that covers what you are about to touch:

- [`docs/dev/ARCHITECTURE.md`](docs/dev/ARCHITECTURE.md) — the modules, the storage seam, who consumes it.
- [`docs/dev/CONVENTIONS.md`](docs/dev/CONVENTIONS.md) — the shared conventions, and what differs here.
- [`docs/dev/TESTING.md`](docs/dev/TESTING.md) — the checks and the coverage floor.
- [`docs/dev/agents.md`](docs/dev/agents.md) — what an agent may change here, and what stops it.

## The constraints that shape everything

1. **Nothing here knows a messenger or a database.** A task points at its source by a locator string;
   the host stores tasks behind `TaskStore` and resolves a locator to a message. `biome.json` refuses
   SQLite, `node:fs`, Drizzle, cli-messaging and messenger libraries under `src/`.
2. **A task never holds message text.** Only the locator. A deleted message leaves nothing here.
3. **`cli-messaging` depends on this package, never the other way round.**
4. **A closed task never opens again.** A rule seeing the same source returns the task it already made;
   only a person or an agent adds a second task to a source, and only of another kind.
5. **A change reaches tg-cli and max-cli only through a release** of this package, then of
   cli-messaging, which both CLIs pin exactly.

## Comments

Sparse, and only *why*. No comment restating the line, no banners, no narrating the change.

## Deletions

Never delete or clean up mid-task. Append a line to [`CLEANUP.md`](CLEANUP.md) — the path, why, the
date — and do the removals in one batch after the owner confirms. Never kill a process by name —
find the PID, confirm it is yours, kill that PID.

## Committing

Conventional commits. Before committing:

```sh
pnpm standards:check && pnpm lint
```

A branch off `main`, in a worktree, and a pull request. A change a caller can see gets a line under
`## Unreleased` in [`CHANGELOG.md`](CHANGELOG.md). `bin/release` on `main` publishes —
[README](README.md#releasing).

## Development check budget

Keep commit and push hooks fast. Ordinary development and PRs use standards
verification, lint, Markdown, and secret detection. Full typechecking, tests,
coverage, builds, parity, browser and platform suites run for releases or an
explicit manual validation. See the
[shared policy](https://github.com/WireCatLabs/community/blob/main/standards/README.md#ci-and-hooks).
